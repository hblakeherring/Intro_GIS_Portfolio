# Intro_GIS_Portfolio
This repository contains the maps created as part of my Intro to GIS Lab. After a semester of class lectures and computer lab work, this portfolio serves as a showcase for my skills as a GIScientist. Each layout is meant to build upon the tools and methods of the previous lab, as well as to apply and display the introductory concepts discussed in class. Now that I have a functional introductory knowledge of ArcGIS, I will look to apply the software's capabilities to find answers to public health questions and problems. (Fall 2017).
